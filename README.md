After reviewing the results of merging the test data, cleaning it and Summary information, bar charts, pie charts, the box plots, the line graph, scatter plot, and the correlation/regression plots, the following trends could be seen.
•	Based upon the statistical summary information, Capomulin and Ramicane had the greatest impact on reducing tumor volume
•	The bar charts showed the greatest number of tests were also completed on Capomulin and Ramicane.
•	The pie charts showed the distribution of male to female was about even within 1% of 50/50.
•	The Quartiles, Outliers and Boxplots showed Capomulin and Ramicane had the greatest impact on reducing tumor volume.
o	Based upon the quartiles, it would appear Ramicane may have slightly better results because the upper quartile was slightly lower as well as the lower quartile.
•	The line plot for mouse l1509 using Capomulin treatment showed the tumor continued to grow until about day 20, then the tumor reduced in sized for the next 15 days, and then started to grow again.  I would appear the observations were stopped after about 45 days.
o	Longer tests may need to be performed to see if the tumors continue to grow.
•	The scatter plot combined with Linear regression showed a positive correlation between mouse weight and average volume of Tumor.
o	It could be concluded that larger mice have larger tumors
o	Possibly there could be a correlation that fatter mice have larger tumors.
Three Conclusions:
1.	Capomulin and Ramicane had the greatest impact on reducing tumor size.
a.	It would appear that it takes about 20 days to take effect
b.	Possibly the drug effect starts to become non-effective after 35 days.
2.	The weight of the mouse seemed to impact the volume of tumor.  (larger mice have more tumor volume).
3.	Ramicane might be slightly better than Capomulin based upon the box plot.
4.	Who ever took the test, may have favored Capomulin and Ramicane because they performed about 20% more tests.
a.	Seems odd the best drugs had the most testing completed.

I used snippits from class notes and reviewing video recordings of class.
I utilized ChatGPT to help me write the scripts.
I consulted with classmate Bobbi Fletchall.
I asked questions of AskBCS Learning Assistant.
